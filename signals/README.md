## Tasks

#### 0. Handle signal

Write a function that set a handler for the signal `SIGINT`

- Prototype: `int handle_signal(void);`
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error
- The program should print `Gotcha! [<signum>]` followed by a new line, every time `Control-C` is pressed (See example below)
  - where `<signum>` must be replaced with the signal number that was caught
- `sigaction`(2) is not allowed

```

- Your function returns a pointer to the current handler of SIGINT, or `NULL` on failure
- You are not allowed to use `sigaction`(2)
- The handler must be unchanged after calling your function

#### 4. Who said that?

Write a function that defines a handler for the signal `SIGQUIT` (`Control-\` in a shell)

- Prototype: `int trace_signal_sender(void);`
- The handler must print `SIGQUIT sent by <pid>` each time a `SIGQUIT` (and only a `SIGQUIT`) is caught
  - Where `<pid>` must be replaced by the PID of the process that sent the signal
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error

#

#### 5. Description

Write a program that prints a description of a given signal

- Usage: `./describe <signum>`
  - Where `<signum>` is the signal number to be described
  - If the number of arguments is not correct, your program must print `Usage: %s <signum>` (where `%s` is argv[0]), followed by a new line, and exit with `EXIT_FAILURE`
- You’re not allowed to have more than `1` function in your file
- You’re not allowed to have more than `12` lines in your function
- You can assume that if a parameter is given, it will be a number

```
alex@~/signals$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 5-signal_describe.c -o 5-signal_describe
alex@~/signals$ ./5-signal_describe
Usage: ./5-signal_describe <signum>

- Directory: `signals`
- File: `5-signal_describe.c`

#

#### 6. Catch a single time

Write a program that sets a handler for the signal `SIGINT`, and exits right after the signal is received and handled

- Your program does not take any argument
- Your program should suspend indefinitely until a signal is received
- When a `SIGINT` is received, you must print `Caught %d` (where `%d` must be replaced by the signal number), followed by a new line
- After the first `SIGINT` is received, your program must:
  - Print `Signal received`, followed by a new line
  - Exit with `EXIT_SUCCESS`
- You are not allowed to use the functions `exit`, `sleep` or `_exit`
- You are not allowed to use any kind of loop (`while`, `for`, `do/while`)

```
alex@~/signals$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 6-suspend.c -o 6-suspend
alex@~/signals$ ./6-suspend 
^CCaught 2
Signal received
alex@~/signals$ echo $?
0
alex@~/signals$
```

- Directory: `signals`
- File: `6-suspend.c`

#

#### 7. Sending a signal

Write a program that sends the signal `SIGINT` to a process, given its PID

- Usage: `signal_send <pid>`
  - Where `<pid>` is the PID of the process to send a signal to
  - If the number of arguments is not correct, your program must print `Usage: %s <pid>` (where `%s` is argv[0]), followed by a new line, and exit with `EXIT_FAILURE`
  - `<pid>` won’t be `0`
- Your program must return `EXIT_SUCCESS` on success, or `EXIT_FAILURE`
- You’re not allowed to have more than `1` function in your file

```
alex@~/signals$ cat 7-main.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Simple program, printing its PID and running infinitely
 *
 * Return: EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE
 */
int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid;

    pid = getpid();
    printf("PID: %d\n", (int)pid);
    while (98)
    {
        printf("Waiting ...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
alex@~/signals$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 7-main.c -o 7-wait_for_it

#

#### 8. Sending a signal in a shell

Write a `sh` script that sends the signal `SIGQUIT` to a process, given its PID

- Usage: `signal_send.sh <pid>`
  - Where `<pid>` is the PID of the process to send a signal to
  - If the number of arguments is not correct, your program must print `Usage: %s <pid>` (where `%s` is argv[0]), followed by a new line, and exit with `1`

```
alex@~/signals$ cat 8-main.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * main - Simple program, printing its PID and running infinitely
 *

int main(void)
{
    pid_t pid;

    pid = getpid();
    printf("PID: %d\n", (int)pid);
    while (98)
    {
        printf("Waiting ...\n");
        sleep(1);
    }
    return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
alex@~/signals$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 8-main.c -o 8-wait_for_it

#

#### 9. Catch with sh

Write a `sh` script that set a handler for the signals `SIGABRT`, `SIGIO` and `SIGTERM`

- The script must print `Nope` followed by a new line, each time a `SIGABRT`, `SIGIO` or `SIGTERM` is caught
- Your script must contain a shebang
- You’re not allowed to have more than 2 lines in your script
- You’re not allowed to have more than 1 instruction per line

```
alex@~/signals$ cat 9-main.sh
#!/bin/sh

#### 11. Blog post

Write a blog post about signals

Your blog post should cover the following:

- What is a signal
- Why do they exist
- When are they delivered and by whom
- What are the default actions of signals
- What happens to a process when it receives a signal without handling it
- What happens to a process when it receives a signal and handles it

Your posts should have examples and at least one picture, at the top. Publish your blog post on `Medium` or `LinkedIn`, and share it at least on `LinkedIn`.

When done, please add all urls below (blog post, tweet, etc.)

Please, remember that these blogs must be written in English to further your technical ability in a variety of settings.

- You’re not allowed to have more than 2 functions in your file
- You’re not allowed to have more than 10 lines in your functions
- You’re not allowed to use `signal`(2)
- In your handler, you must use the function `psiginfo` to print information about the signal received (see example below)

#### 13. Sigset

Write a function that initializes a sigset

- Prototype: `int sigset_init(sigset_t *set, int *signals);`
- Where `set` is a pointer to the signal set to initialize
- And `signals` is a `0-terminated` array of int, each one being a signal number
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error

```
alex@~/signals$ cat 101-main.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "signals.h"

/**

 * @set: Set to be printed
 */

{
    int sig;
    int cnt;

    cnt = 0;
    for (sig = 1; sig < NSIG; sig++)
    {
        if (sigismember(set, sig))
        {
            cnt++;
            printf("%d (%s)\n", sig, strsignal(sig));
        }
    }
    if (cnt == 0)
        printf("Empty signal set\n");

#### 14. Block signals

Write a function that block a given set of signals from being delivered to the current process

- Prototype: `int signals_block(int *signals);`
- Where `signals` is a `0-terminated` array of int, each one being a signal to block
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error
- You’re not allowed to use either `signal`(2) nor `sigaction`(2)

#### 15. Unblock signals

Write a function that unblock a given set of signals from being delivered to the current process

- Prototype: `int signals_unblock(int *signals);`
- Where `signals` is a `0-terminated` array of int, each one being a signal to unblock
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error
- You’re not allowed to use either `signal`(2) nor `sigaction`(2)

#### 16. Handle pending signals

Write a function that sets up a handler for all the pending signals of the current process

- Prototype: `int handle_pending(void (*handler)(int));`
- Where `handler` is a pointer to the handler function to set for the pending signals
- Your function must return `0` on success, or `-1` on error
- You’re not allowed to use `signal`(2)
