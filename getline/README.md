# C - Static Variables, Getline

## Resources

[Static Variables in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-variables-in-c/)

## Objectives

- What are static variables?
- How and when to use them?

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu` 20.04 LTS
- Your C programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc` 9.4.0
  - FLAGS: -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- All your header files should be include guarded
- You are allowed to have up to 6 functions in `_getline.c`

### Allowed Functions and System Calls

- `<unistd.h>`
  - read
  - write

- `<stdlib.h>`
  - malloc
  - realloc
  - free

- `<string.h>`
  - strcpy
  - strncpy
  - strcat
  - strdup
  - memset
  - memcpy

## Tasks

0. Racing cars

- Write a function that keeps track of the number of laps made by several cars in a race.
  - Prototype : void race_state(int *id, size_t size)
  - id is an array of int representing the “identifier” of each car.
    - size is the size of this array
    - Each car identifier is unique
    - If an identifier is unknown:
      - Create a new car with the number of laps = 0
      - Print Car X joined the race followed by a new line (where X is the identifier)
  - Each time the function is called:
    - The number of laps of each cars listed in id must be incremented by 1
    - Print the state of the race:
      - Header: Race state: followed by a new line
      - For each car sorted by the identifier: Car X [Y laps] (where X is the identifier and Y the number of laps already done)
  - If your function is called with size = 0,you must free all allocated memory.

1. _getline

- Write a function that reads an entire line from a file descriptor.
  - Prototype : char *_getline(const int fd)
  - Where fd is the file descriptor to read from
  - If there are no more lines to return, or if there is an error, the function should return NULL
  - The function returns a null-terminated string that does not include the newline character
  - Your header file_getline.h should define a macro called READ_SIZE.
    - This macro defines the number of bytes you will read each time you will call read: read(fd, buffer, READ_SIZE)
    - You are not allowed to read more or less than READ_SIZE bytes at once from fd
    - You are free to pick the value that you want for READ_SIZE
  - You can assume that fd will always be the same

2. _getline: multi-fd

- Handle multiple file descriptors.
  - when called with -1 you should free everything and reset all your static variables
